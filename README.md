## Spotify Sharer


This is a web I built in React and deployed in Render in which you can sign up with a groupname and a password you share with friends in order to share music through spotify links 
so as to have the music you (or you and your friends) like and want to share in several cute lists :) 🎵
It has a static frontend dist built from this other repository: [Frontend Repository](https://github.com/isalamajor/spotify-sharer)
